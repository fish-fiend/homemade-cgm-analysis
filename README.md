### Upcoming Features: 
  - option to change units between mmol/L and mg/dL (currently mg/dL is the only choice)
  - ability to upload multiple files at once and have them be automatically joined to create a single cohesive plot
      - since dexcom only allows data to be downloaded in 90 day chunks, if only one file can be added/processed at a time
        then you won't be able to get a complete picture of your data over any timespan greater than 90 days. and examining
        that sort of long-term behaviour is kind of the whole point of this. so this is my most pressing issue
  - make the font more readable
  - extend compatability beyond dexcom to other cgm brands
  - percent of time in range (pie chart perhaps?)
