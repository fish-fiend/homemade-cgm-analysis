### TESTING
  Here's a link to the [website](gfournier.shinyapps.io/cgm-analysis-longterm/). 
  Please close the tab when you're done with it because if the site gets too much runtime the web host will try to make me pay them money.
  
  And you need to upload data for the graphics to render so here's some of my own >>

  I also uploaded some [demo videos](https://www.youtube.com/@gf0ur) to youtube for more information about using the app and interpreting results. They will almost definitely be slightly outdated though.

### UPCOMING FEATURES
  - faster upload processing
    - should improve gradually as I refine the code, eliminating redundancy in data processing and graphic rendering
  - option to change units between mmol/L and mg/dL (currently mg/dL is the only choice)
    - isn't too hard conceptually, but will be very boring and time consuming
  - <s>little buttons that display tips/info when pressed</s> ☑️
  - aesthetic changes: dark mode option for the averages graph (maybe)
  - <s>better colors for the violin plot</s> ☑️
  - <s>make the font more readable</s> ☑️
  - <s>percent of time in range (pie chart perhaps?)</s> ☑️
