### TESTING
  Here's a link to the [website](https://gyfour.shinyapps.io/cgm-analysis-longterm/). 
  Please close the tab when you're done with it because if the site gets too much runtime the web host will try to make me pay them money.
  
  I also uploaded some [demo videos](https://www.youtube.com/@gf0ur) to youtube for more information about using the app and interpreting results. They will almost definitely be slightly outdated though.

### <s> ISSUE WITH THE VIOLIN PLOT IS BACK FOR VENGEANCE
  The date range input for the violin plot is malfunctioning again for apparently no reason. I'm investigating. </s>
  
  FIXED! If this happens again I might cry!

### UPCOMING FEATURES
  - faster upload processing
    - should improve gradually as I refine the code, eliminating redundancy in data processing and graphic rendering
  - option to change units between mmol/L and mg/dL (currently mg/dL is the only choice)
    - isn't too hard conceptually, but will be very boring and time consuming
  - <s>little buttons that display tips/info when pressed</s> ☑️
  - aesthetic changes: dark mode option for the averages graph (maybe)
  - <s>better colors for the violin plot</s> ☑️
  - <s>make the font more readable</s> ☑️
  - <s>percent of time in range (pie chart perhaps?)</s> ☑️
