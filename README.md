### TEST DATA
  Here's a link to the website >>  [gfournier.shinyapps.io/cgm-analysis-longterm/](gfournier.shinyapps.io/cgm-analysis-longterm/) 
  
  And you need to upload data for the graphics to render so here's some of my own >>

### CURRENT PROJECT
My highest priority rn is integrating a violin plot that shows glycemic variability by day. I'm realllly excited about it but I'm struggling to figure out how to make the axes adjustable with a date range input. reactiveVal() is not playing nicely with the other kids

### UPCOMING FEATURES
  - faster upload processing
  - option to change units between mmol/L and mg/dL (currently mg/dL is the only choice)
  - <s>make the font more readable</s> ☑️
  - dark mode option for the graph (maybe)
  - <s>percent of time in range (pie chart perhaps?)</s> ☑️
