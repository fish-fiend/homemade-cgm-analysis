### Upcoming Features: 
  - ability to change units between mmol/L and mg/dL (currently mg/dL is the only option)
  - ability to upload multiple files at once and have them be automatically joined to create a single cohesive plot
      - since dexcom only allows data to be downloaded in 90 day chunks, if only one file can be added/processed at a time
        then you won't be able to get a complete picture of your data over any timespan greater than 90 days. and that sort of
        long-term analysis is kind of the whole point of this. so this is my most pressing issue
