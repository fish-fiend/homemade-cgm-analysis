### TEST DATA
  Here's a link to the website >>  [gfournier.shinyapps.io/cgm-analysis-longterm/](gfournier.shinyapps.io/cgm-analysis-longterm/) 
  
  And you need to upload data for the graphics to render so here's some of my own >>

### MOST PRESSING (and hardest to solve) ISSUE — FIXED ☑️
I finally made it possible for up to 4 files (at most an entire year's worth of data!) to be uploaded and analyzed as one dataset!! ANNNNNDDDDD  I figured out how to turn the indexing/substitution step into a function in order to replace the out-of-range "High" and "Low" values with "400" and "40" <strong>without</strong> sacrificing the ability to wrangle multiple files at once!

### UPCOMING FEATURES
  - faster upload processing
  - option to change units between mmol/L and mg/dL (currently mg/dL is the only choice)
  - make the font more readable
  - dark mode option for the graph (maybe)
  - extend compatability beyond dexcom to other cgm brands
  - <s>percent of time in range (pie chart perhaps?)</s> ☑️
