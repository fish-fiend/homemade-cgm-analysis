### MOST PRESSING (and hardest to solve) ISSUE â€” FIXED!
I finally made it possible for multiple files to be uploaded and analyzed as one dataset!!! Unfortunately, it did come at a cost. Now I need to figure out
how to turn the indexing/substitution step into a function in order to replace the out-of-range "High" and "Low" values with "400" and "40" <strong>without</strong> 
sacrificing the ability to wrangle multiple files at once. I feel like I'm soooooo close to a solution, but nothing I've been trying works how I expect
it to.  

Also the graph kinda glitches if you upload two datasets that are not consecutive, but it's a fairly innocent problem so I'm going to worry about it later.

### Upcoming Features: 
  - option to change units between mmol/L and mg/dL (currently mg/dL is the only choice)
  - make the font more readable
  - dark mode option for the graph (maybe)
  - extend compatability beyond dexcom to other cgm brands
  - percent of time in range (pie chart perhaps?)
